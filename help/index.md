## Getting Started

To begin navigate to `On My iPad/TeXtonic` or `On My iPhone/TeXtonic`. Note: TeXtonic can only compile documents in this directory or in the `iCloud/TeXtonic` directory.

This folder will contain an example project in a directory called `Example`. The Folder will contain a file called `Main.tex.` Tap on the file to open it. 

## The Document View

To compile the document tap on the hammer icon in the toolbar. Once the document compiles, tap on the `PDF` in the toolbar. To get more information on the document such as a document outline, tap on the side bar icon in the toolbar at the far left. You can close the document by tapping the folder icon on the left of the document name in the toolbar. 

## Multi document projects

You can include files in your main project file by using `\include{Filename.tex}`. If you have multiple files in your project, a tab view will appear below the toolbar. This is a horizontally scrolling list of your included files.
